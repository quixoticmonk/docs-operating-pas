This topic describes the procedure for adding existing SAML or LDAP users to a <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment enabled with SAML or LDAP.

The following two ways exist to add existing SAML or LDAP users to your <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment:

* [Option 1: Import Users in Bulk](#bulk-import)
* [Option 2: Add Users Manually](#manual)


## <a id='prereqs'></a> Prerequisites

To perform the procedures in this topic, you must have:

* Admin access to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard for your <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment
* The [Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](../cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) (cf CLI) v6.23.0 or later


## <a id='bulk-import'></a> Option 1: Import Users in Bulk

You can import SAML or LDAP users in bulk by using the CF-MGMT Tool. For instructions about installing and using the tool, see [the CF-MGMT README](https://github.com/pivotalservices/cf-mgmt).


## <a id='manual'></a> Option 2: Add Users Manually

The following sections describe how to add existing SAML or LDAP users to your <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment manually.

### <a id='step-id'></a> Step 1: Create User

To add a SAML or LDAP user:

1. Target the API endpoint for your <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment by running:

    ```
    cf target https://api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
    ```
    Where `YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is your system domain.

1. Run `cf login` and provide credentials for an account with the [Admin user role](../concepts/roles.html#roles):

1. Create the user in UAA by running:

    ```
    cf create-user EXAMPLE-USERNAME --origin YOUR-PROVIDER-NAME
    ```
    Where:
    * `EXAMPLE-USERNAME` is the username of the SAML or LDAP user you want to add.
    * `YOUR-PROVIDER-NAME` is `ldap` for an LDAP user, or the name of the SAML provider you provided when configuring Ops Manager for a SAML user.

### <a id='user-role'></a> Step 2: Associate User with Org or Space Role

After creating the SAML or LDAP user, you must associate the user with either an Org or Space role.

For more information about roles, see the [Roles and Permissions](../concepts/roles.html#roles) section of the _Orgs, Spaces, Roles, and Permissions_ topic.

#### <a id='org-role'></a> Associate User with Org Role

To associate the SAML or LDAP user with an Org role:

1. Run:

    ```
    cf set-org-role USERNAME YOUR-ORG ROLE
    ```
    Where:
    * `USERNAME` is the name of the SAML or LDAP user.
    * `YOUR-ORG` is the name of your org.

For `ROLE`, enter one of the following:

* `OrgManager`: Org Managers can invite and manage users, select and change plans, and set spending limits.
* `BillingManager`: Billing Managers can create and manage the billing account and payment information.
* `OrgAuditor`: Org Auditors have read-only access to Org information and reports.

For example:

```
cf set-org-role j.smith<span>@</span>example.com my-org OrgManager
```

#### <a id='space-role'></a> Associate User with Space Role

To associate the SAML or LDAP user with a Space role:

1. Run:

    ```
    cf set-space-role USERNAME YOUR-ORG YOUR-SPACE ROLE
    ```
    Where:
    * `USERNAME` is the name of the SAML or LDAP user.
    * `YOUR-ORG` is the name of your org.
    * `YOUR-SPACE` is the name of a space in your org.

For `ROLE`, enter one of the following:

* `SpaceManager`: Space Managers can invite and manage users, and enable features for a given Space.
* `SpaceDeveloper`: Space Developers can create and manage apps and services, and see logs and reports.
* `SpaceAuditor`: Space Auditors can view logs, reports, and settings on this Space.

For example:

```
cf set-space-role j.smith<span>@</span>example.com my-org my-space SpaceDeveloper
```
