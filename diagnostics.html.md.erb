<% current_page.data.title = "Diagnosing Problems in " + vars.platform_name %>

This topic provides guidance for diagnosing issues encountered during an <%= vars.platform_name %>

installation.

Besides whether products install successfully or not, an important consideration when diagnosing issues is communication between VMs deployed by <%= vars.platform_name %>. Depending on what products you install, communication takes the form of messaging, routing, or both. If they go wrong, an installation can fail. For example, in an Pivotal Application Service (PAS) installation the <%= vars.platform_name %> VM tries to push a test app to the cloud during post-installation testing. The installation fails if the resulting traffic cannot be routed to the HA Proxy load balancer.


## <a id='debug'></a> Viewing the Debug Endpoint

The debug endpoint is a web page that provides information useful for diagnostics. If you have superuser privileges and can view the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, you can access the debug endpoint.

In a browser, open the URL:

```
https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/debug
```

Where `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` is the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of your Ops Manager installation.

The debug endpoint offers three links:

* *Files* allows you to view the YAML files that Ops Manager uses to configure products that you install. The most important YAML file, `installation.yml`, provides networking settings and describes `microbosh`. In this case, `microbosh` is the VM whose BOSH Director component is used by Ops Manager to perform installations and updates of PAS and other products.

* *Components* describes the components in detail.

* *Rails log* shows errors thrown by the VM where the Ops Manager web app, such as a Rails app, is running, as recorded in the `production.log` file. To explore other logs, see [Logging Tips](#tips).

### <a id='starting'> </a> Identifying Where to Start

This section contains general tips for locating where a particular problem is called out in the log files. For guidance regarding specific logs, such as those for PAS components, see the sections below.

* Start with the largest and most recently updated files in the job log.
* Identify logs that contain `err` in the name.
* Scan the file contents for a "failed" or "error" string.

### <a id='component_logs'></a> Viewing Logs for PAS Components

To troubleshoot specific PAS components by viewing their log files:

1. Navigate to your Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click on the PAS tile.

1. Select the **Status** tab.

1. In the **Job** column, locate the component you want to troubleshoot.

1. In the **Logs** column for the component, click the download icon.

    <%= image_tag("troubleshooting/status.png") %>

1. Select the **Logs** tab.

    <%= image_tag("troubleshooting/logs.png") %>

1. Once the ZIP file corresponding to the component moves to the **Downloaded** list, click the linked file path to download the ZIP file.

1. Once the download completes, unzip the file.

The contents of the log directory vary depending on which component you view. For example, the Diego Cell log directory contains subdirectories for the `metron_agent` `rep`, `monit`, and `garden` processes. To view the standard error stream for `garden`, download the Diego Cell logs and open `diego.0.job > garden > garden.stderr.log`.

### <a id='view_in_terminal'></a> Viewing Web App and BOSH Failure Logs in a Terminal Window

You can obtain diagnostic information from Ops Manager by logging in to the VM where it is running. To log in to the Ops Manager VM, you need:

* The IP address of the <%= vars.platform_name %> VM shown in the **Settings** tab of the Ops Manager Director tile.

* Your **import credentials**. Import credentials are the username and password used to import the <%= vars.platform_name %> `.ova` or `.ovf` file into your virtualization system.

To log in to the Ops Manager VM:

1. Open a terminal window.

1. To connect to the <%= vars.platform_name %> installation VM, run:

    ```
    ssh IMPORT-USERNAME@<%= vars.platform_code %>-VM-IP-ADDRESS
    ```
    Where:
    * `IMPORT-USERNAME` is the username you used to import the `.ova` or `.ovf` file into your virtualization system.
    * `VM-IP-ADDRESS` is the IP address of the <%= vars.platform_name %> installation VM.

1. Enter your import password when prompted.

1. Go to the home directory of the web app by running:

    ```
    cd /home/tempest-web/tempest/web/
    ```

1. You are now in a position to explore whether things are as they should be within the web app. You can also verify that the `microbosh` component is successfully installed. A successful MicroBOSH installation is required to install PAS and any products like databases and messaging services.

1. Change directories to the BOSH installation log home by running:

    ```
    cd /var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments/micro
    ```

1. You may want to begin by running a tail command on the `current` log. Run:

    ```
    cd /var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments/micro
    ```
    If you are unable to resolve an issue by viewing configurations, exploring logs, or reviewing common problems, you can troubleshoot further by running BOSH diagnostic commands with the BOSH Command Line Interface (CLI).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Do not manually modify the deployment manifest. Ops Manager overwrites manual changes to this manifest. In addition, manually changing the manifest may cause future deployments to fail.</p>

## <a id='console-logs'></a> Viewing Apps Manager Logs in a Terminal Window

Apps Manager provides a graphical user interface to help manage organizations, users, apps, and spaces. For more information about Apps Manager, see [Getting Started with Apps Manager](../console/dev-console.html)

When troubleshooting Apps Manager performance, you might want to view the Apps Manager app logs. To view the Apps Manager app logs:

1. From a command line, log in to <%= vars.platform_name %> by running:

    ```
    cf login -a api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN -u admin
    ```
    Where `YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is your system domain.
    <br>
    When prompted, enter your UAA Administrator credentials. To obtain these credentials, see **Credentials** tab in the PAS tile.

1. Target the `system` org and the `apps-manager` space by running:

    ```
    cf target -o system -s apps-manager
    ```

1. Tail the Apps Manager logs by running:

    ```
    cf logs apps-manager
    ```

### <a id='changing-log-level'></a> Changing Logging Levels for Apps Manager

Apps Manager recognizes the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable. The `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable allows you to filter the messages reported in Apps Manager log files by severity level. Apps Manager defines severity levels using the Ruby standard library [Logger class](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html).

By default, the Apps Manager `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable is set to `info`. The logs show more verbose messaging when you set the `LOG_LEVEL` to `debug`.

To change the Apps Manager `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable, run:

```
cf set-env apps-manager LOG_LEVEL LEVEL
```

Where `LEVEL` is the desired severity level.

You can set `LOG_LEVEL` to one of the six severity levels defined by the Ruby Logger class:

* **Level 5**: `unknown` -- An unknown message that should always be logged.
* **Level 4**: `fatal` -- An unhandleable error that results in a program crash.
* **Level 3**: `error` -- A handleable error condition.
* **Level 2**: `warn` -- A warning.
* **Level 1**: `info` -- General information about system operation.
* **Level 0**: `debug` -- Low-level information for developers.

Once set, Apps Manager log files only include messages at the set severity level and above. For example, if you set `LOG_LEVEL` to `fatal`, the log includes `fatal` and `unknown` level messages only.
