## <a id='lb'></a> Load Balancer

PAS includes an HAProxy load balancer for terminating SSL. If you do not want to serve SSL certificates for PAS on your own load balancer, use the HAProxy. If you choose to manage SSL yourself, omit the HAProxy by setting the number of instances to zero in Ops Manager.


## <a id='router'></a> Router

The routers in PAS are responsible for routing HTTP requests from web clients to app instances in a load-balanced fashion. The routers are dynamically configured based on users mapping of apps to location URLs called routes, and updated by the runtime service as app instances are dynamically distributed.

For high availability, the routers are designed to be horizontally scalable. Configure your load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across all router instances.
